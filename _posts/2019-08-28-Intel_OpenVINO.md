Inverse kinematics (IK) technology was launched in the robotics field and studied to calculate joint angles to move robot arms (end effectors) to the target position with specific degrees of freedom (Figure 1). IK uses kinematic equations to determine the joint angles so that the end effector moves to a desired position. IK technology is now applied to many other areas such as engineering, computer graphics, and video games.

IK animation makes character motions appear more natural and reactive in a game environment. For example, it can be used to keep a character’s feet planted on uneven ground or on stairs. It can also be used for a character’s hand hold on moving objects.

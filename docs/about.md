## Motion AI Team

Motion AI Team believes that the virtual character will become more realistic than the human beings.
Eventually, people could communicate with virtual entertainers in real life, and play with them in the virtual world. <br>
To prepare for that era, our team members focus on generating natural motions of virtual character.
The motions we are interested in creating are not only imitating how humans act, but also learning and expressing how humans feel.

Currently, we eager to find the solution among deep learning approaches using motion capture data. <br>
NCSOFT has a world-level motion capture studio and professional technicians. AI Center at NCSOFT has started in 2012, and has been applying various AI algorithms to commercial games. Based on these environments Motion AI Team at AI Center, NCOSFT is continuously researching novel motion algorithms and trying to apply the algorithms to our game characters. <br>
